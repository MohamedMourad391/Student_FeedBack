# Student_FeedBack
This project involves building a data engineering pipeline to analyze student feedback. It includes:

Collecting feedback data from various sources.
Transforming and organizing the data into a data warehouse using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
Developing a sentiment analysis machine learning model using Python.
Deploying a web application to showcase the sentiment analysis model.
The aim is to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for data engineering and machine learning in the education domain.

# Abstract

This project outlines a comprehensive approach to analyzing and improving student feedback through advanced data management and machine learning techniques.

SQL database designed and populated with student feedback data.
Data warehouse implemented for in-depth analysis across courses, instructors, and feedback categories.
Python scripts for data preprocessing and sentiment analysis.
MLOps techniques to deploy models via a dashboard, enabling real-time monitoring and feedback improvement.
Outcomes showcase data-driven insights to enhance the student learning experience by targeting areas for improvement in teaching and course content.

# Introduction

Continuous improvement based on student feedback is essential in education. This project:

Builds a structured SQL database.
Implements a data warehouse for advanced analysis.
Uses Python for sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative).
Deploys sentiment analysis models with MLOps for real-time insights.
Project Phases
1. SQL Database Setup and Data Collection
Data Source: Faculty of Education, Ain Shams University.

Columns: Student_id, subject_title, subject_grade
Records: 96,046
Steps:

Clean and structure student data.
Import data using SQL Server tools.
Ensure data integrity (no duplicates, consistent formats).
Database Design:

Tables:
Program
Student
Instructor
Department
Subject
Feedback Questions
2. Data Warehouse and Python Data Processing
Fact Table: Feedback

Dimension Tables: Student, Courses, Instructor, Feedback Questions

Steps:

Extract, transform, and load (ETL) feedback data into the warehouse.
Clean data using Python (removing duplicates, handling missing values, text normalization).
Text Preprocessing with Python:

Tokenization
Stopword removal
Stemming/Lemmatization
3. Sentiment Analysis
Na√Øve Bayes Model:
Preprocess feedback text.
Categorize as positive, neutral, or negative using NLTK tools.
4. MLOps and Deployment
Create a simple web page for sentiment prediction using Flask in VS Code.
Flask
NLTK
